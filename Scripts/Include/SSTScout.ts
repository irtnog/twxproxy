# Passed:    $Ports - Count-based array of possible work ports

#            $Warp~DropFig - Type of figs to drop while warping
#                       "N" = None, "D" = Defensive, "O" = Offensive, "T" = Toll
#            $WorldSST~BustList - Bust list boolean array
# Triggered: Sector command prompt
