# SUB:       SellSteal
# Clockable: Yes, but not during initialisation.  Port MUST be heavily upgraded.  And must use quicksell
# Passed:    $experience - experience of player
#            $stealFactor - steal factor (i.e. 30 for 100%)
#            $Haggle~HaggleFactor - haggle factor for sell (i.e. 5)
#            $Sector - individual number identifying port details
#            $PortClass - "0" for no quicksell, otherwise is class of port in sector
# Triggered: Sector command prompt
# Returned:  $success - "2" if errored, "1" if success, "0" if busted
#            $holdsLost - equals holds lost if busted
#            $experience - updated player experience
#            $turns - updated player turns
