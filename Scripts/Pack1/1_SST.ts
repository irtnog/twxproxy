# TWX Script Pack 1: Sell-Steal-Transport script
# Author           : Xide
# Description      : SST money making script for evils - a more advanced
#                    version of SSM which uses less turns by transporting
#                    between ships.  The first sector stolen from is the
#                    OPPOSITE to the one the player is in.
# Trigger Point    : Sector prompt containing xxB port with second ship
#                    aligned with another xxB port.
# Warnings         : Make sure you havn't been busted at either port.  Ensure
#                    The last port stolen from is NOT the sector
#                    you will be SSTing to.  Also make sure the holds you
#                    are stealing are not greater than the ideal amount.
#                    Failure to follow any of these precautions will bust
#                    you.  Also make sure both sectors are free from
#                    obstruction and that both ships are withing transport
#                    range of eachother.
# Other            : Quite a simple script, simply runs until the player
#                    is busted.  Unless the game's steal ratio has been
#                    changed, the ideal steal amount should be 1 hold
#                    for 30 experience.
