# TWX Script Pack 1: Fast Zero Turn Mapping script
# Author           : Xide
# Description      : This version of the TWX Proxy ZTM script is much faster than
#                    1_ZTM, although not as accurate.  I find to get a good picture 
#                    of the game and an accurate bubble list, you should do at least 
#                    3 passes of Source -> destination/incremental
#                    mappings then export a bubble list and map at least 3 times to
#                    different sources using the exported list.
#
#                    For example:
#
#                    Pass 1:  Reverse sector mapping
#                    Pass 2:  Incremental mapping (using an incremental of 1)
#                    Pass 3:  Incremental mapping (using an incremental of 2)
#                    Pass 4:  Exported bubble list to sector 1 mapping
#                    Pass 5:  Another exported bubble list to sector 50 mapping
#                    Pass 6:  Another exported bubble list to sector 51 mapping
#
#                    Doing the above would get you an accurate picture of the game.
#                    Depending upon connection/server speed this could easily be done
#                    in under 3 hours in a 5k sector game.
# Trigger Point    : CIM Prompt
# Warnings         : Make sure your avoids are cleared when you begin
#                    this script.
# Other            : This script makes use of Script Windows.  These items
#                    are not supported in TWX Proxy 2.00, but the utilisation
#                    remains for future versions.
