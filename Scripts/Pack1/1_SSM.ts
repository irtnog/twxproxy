# TWX Script Pack 1: Sell-Steal-Move script
# Author           : Xide
# Description      : SSM script for evils.  The first steal is from the
#                    sector the player is in.  Basically the script 
#                    just jumps between the two ports, selling then stealing
#                    equipment.  Your holds must be empty when you run this
#                    script.
# Trigger Point    : Sector containing an xxB port, with an xxB port adjacent
# Warnings         : Make sure you havn't been busted at either port.  Ensure
#                    The last port stolen from is NOT the sector you are in.
#                    Also make sure you set your steal factor correctly.
#                    Failure to follow any of these precautions will bust
#                    you.  Also make sure both sectors are free from
#                    obstruction and that your not SSMing through a one
#                    way warp.
