# TWX Script Pack 1: Zero Turn Mapping script
# Author           : Xide
# Description      : A HORRIFICALLY slow ZTM script.  Plots courses from
#                    a source sector to every other sector in the game and
#                    back, setting avoids at every calculation to make
#                    sure no warps are missed.  VERY accurate, but VERY
#                    slow! :(
#                    Always write down the last sector it plotted the
#                    course to so that you can resume the script from that
#                    point.
# Trigger Point    : CIM Prompt
# Warnings         : Make sure your avoids are cleared when you begin
#                    this script.
# Other            : This script makes use of Script Windows.  These items
#                    are not supported in TWX Proxy 2.00, but the utilisation
#                    remains for future versions.

# check if we can run it from here
