# TWX Script Pack 1: Express colonisation script
# Author           : Xide
# Description      : Express warps between terra and the planet, grabbing
#                    and dropping off colonists.  Heavy on turns, so its
#                    only really good for unlimited turn games.  Also very
#                    unsafe.  I wouldn't do it with aggressive players
#                    online.
# Trigger Point    : Target planet surface
# Warnings         : Express route to and from terra must be clear of all
#                    obstruction.  Assumes the sector with the target
#                    planet has either multiple planets or that the ship
#                    being used has a planet scanner (no quick landing).
#                    Always works one cycle ahead of its position, so
#                    make sure your parameters are right or you'll go
#                    treking around the game.  Doesn't keep track of your
#                    turns so keep an eye on them.
# Other            : Good script to play around with if you want to learn
#                    something.  Its simple and straight forward.

# check if we can run it from here
