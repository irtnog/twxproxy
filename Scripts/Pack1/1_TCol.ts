# TWX Script Pack 1: Trans-colonisation script
# Author           : Xide
# Description      : Colonisation script which twarps to terra and back.  Can
#                    obtain fuel from any planet or port within the target
#                    sector.
# Trigger Point    : Target planet surface
# Warnings         : NO BLIND WARP PROTECTION - make sure your alignment is
#                    above 1000 and you have figs in the target sector!
#                    Assumes the target sector has multiple planets or the
#                    ship has a planet scanner (no quick landings).  Doesn't
#                    keep track of your turns so keep an eye on them.
#                    Make sure you have cleared avoids as they can cause
#                    miscalculations of warp distance in rare occasions.
# Other            : A moderately complex script as it has to calculate the
#                    fuel ore required to get to and from terra.  Fairly
#                    straightforward though.

# check if we can run it from here
