# TWX Script Pack 1: Basic trade script
# Author           : Xide
# Description      : Navigates the game through the use of a density scanner,
#                    running holo scans on sectors with unusual density.
#                    Docks at ports while it does this.  Useless in low turn
#                    games.
# Trigger Point    : Sector command prompt
# Warnings         : Don't run in low turn games.  Script has no defences
#                    so is easily destroyed by other players.  Easily
#                    obstructed by non port sectors with 100 density.
# Other            : A modified version of 1_Scout.  Very basic porting method
#                    of just sending the port command followed by lots of
#                    enters.

# check if we can run it from here
