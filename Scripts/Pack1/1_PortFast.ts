# TWX Script Pack 1: Fast port pair trading script
# Author           : Xide
# Description      : A faster but much less efficient version of 1_Port.twx.
#                    Simply runs between each port sector sending the command
#                    to port followed by a bunch of enters.  Very fast, but
#                    doesn't haggle and doesn't trade the best product.
# Trigger Point    : Sector command prompt
# Warnings         : Ports must have enough products on board to make
#                    this script worthwhile.  Ideally trading should stop
#                    once a port hits below 20%.  This script assumes
#                    there are no one-way warps between ports and that
#                    they are adjacent to eachother.  Be
#                    sure there are no obstructions in either sector.
# Other            : This is an excellent script to play around with and
#                    use to learn the language.  Its simple and doesn't
#                    twist all over the place like 1_Port.twx.
