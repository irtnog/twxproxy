# TWX Script Pack 1: Port pair trading script
# Author           : Xide
# Description      : Trades between two sectors with ports, buying and
#                    selling products between them.
#                    Haggles with a variable markup/markdown.
#                    First docking is at the CURRENT sector of the player.
# Trigger Point    : Sector command prompt
# Warnings         : Ports must have enough products on board to make
#                    this script worthwhile.  Ideally trading should stop
#                    once a port hits below 20%.  This script assumes
#                    there are no one-way warps between ports and that
#                    they are adjacent to eachother.  Be
#                    sure there are no obstructions in either sector.
# Other            : I wouldn't try learning the script language here,
#                    this script is quite complex and basically goes all
#                    over the damn place :)

# check if we can run it from here
