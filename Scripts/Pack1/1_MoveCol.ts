# TWX Script Pack 1: Move colonist script
# Author           : Xide
# Description      : Move colonists from one planet to another.  Can work
#                    with planets which are multiple hops apart.  Assumes
#                    the ship being used to transport has a planet scanner,
#                    or that there are multiple planets in each sector.
# Trigger Point    : Source planet surface
# Warnings         : If transporting between multiple hops, be sure the
#                    warp lane between the sectors is clear and no additional
#                    prompts will be given.  This script will express warp.
# Other            : Moderately complex script as it does warp calculations
#                    to check the distance between planets.

# check if we can run it from here
